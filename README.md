# -Chess-
Chess developed in C++ using features of OOP, and SFML for graphics.
Overview
This project is a fully functional chess game developed in C++ using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) for graphics. The game is designed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase.

# Features
Graphical Interface: The game features a user-friendly graphical interface powered by SFML.
Full Chess Mechanics: Implements all standard chess rules, including piece movements, captures, check, checkmate, and stalemate.
Two-Player Mode: Allows two players to play against each other on the same machine.
Move Validation: Ensures all moves are valid according to chess rules.
Highlighting: Highlights valid moves for the selected piece.
Player Selection Logic: Manages turns and player interactions.
Customizable Board: The board and pieces can be customized with different textures.
Installation
Prerequisites
C++ Compiler: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++, clang++).
SFML Library: Download and install SFML from SFML's official website

# Usage
